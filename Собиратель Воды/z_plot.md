# EXODUS FROM NETJERU: SUMMARY (FINAL VERSION)

## PROLOGUE: THE DEPARTURE OF THE GODS

The brother gods Sebek and Hapi created a civilization based on a great river and miraculous water crystals. Three hundred years ago, the gods unexpectedly disappeared, after which the river began to dry up and the crystals began to lose their power. Without divine guidance, humanity slowly sinks into a crisis where every drop of water becomes a treasure.

## CHAPTER 1: THE LAST CRYSTAL

Engineer Amon studies the last functioning crystal of Netjeru and concludes that the city has only a few months left. With the support of priestess Nefrit, he conducts a secret experiment to restore the crystal, which leads to an explosion. For heresy, Amon is sentenced to exile in the desert with a three-day water supply.

## CHAPTER 2: SAMIRA

On the third day of wandering, the dying-of-thirst Amon is found by raiders led by Samira. Learning of his engineering skills, she offers a deal: life in exchange for fixing a water-finding compass. Working on the device, Amon discovers that the raiders' technologies are closer to the original divine ones than their city counterparts.

## CHAPTER 3: CARAVAN CROSSROADS

Samira takes Amon to a trading crossroads where they meet the informant Nazim. In exchange for repairing a distiller, the merchant reveals information about ancient scrolls with water technologies and the hermit Idris living in a mountain temple. Here, Nazim also tells of a new desert threat – the "Thirsting Ones," a band of refugees from the destroyed northern city of Kusra who, not knowing desert traditions of water conservation, deplete one well after another, leaving dead land in their wake.

## CHAPTER 4: RASHID'S OASIS

After intercepting a caravan with scrolls, the group arrives at Sheikh Rashid's oasis, where prosperity is maintained without crystals. The sheikh's daughter, inventor Zara, shows Amon ingenious water collection and irrigation systems. The oasis is in crisis – the level of underground sources is falling due to drought for the first time in decades. Rashid worries that the "Thirsting Ones" will learn about their oasis.

## CHAPTER 5: IDRIS'S TEMPLE

In a rocky valley, the group finds an ancient temple where former priest Idris survives using ancient water collection methods, raising goats and growing drought-resistant crops. They discover that Idris occasionally partakes in a ritual involving a rare desert cactus, which induces powerful visions. He believes these aren't mere hallucinations but direct communications with the essence of the world that the gods themselves once accessed. These visions, recorded in cryptic journals, have guided his survival techniques and water-finding abilities.

## CHAPTER 6: BITTER TRUTH AND SACRED VISIONS

Amon initially dismisses Idris's visionary practices as the delusions of an isolated old man. However, when the "Thirsting Ones" threaten and water becomes desperately scarce, Idris conducts a ritual and invites Amon to participate. During the ceremony, both experience vivid visions of mountains collecting moisture from winds, of underground rivers flowing beneath specific rock formations, and of the brothers Sebek and Hapi themselves discovering these mountains before bringing their people to the river. These visions, combined with Idris's ancient texts, reveal that the Nihr River was an artificial divine creation while the mountains represent a natural water system that predates the gods themselves. The vision ends with a clear message: "Return to the cradle of the gods."

## CHAPTER 7: RETURN TO NETJERU

Shaken by the vision but still skeptical, Amon decides to return to Netjeru to warn the inhabitants of the impending catastrophe, while Samira and Zara prepare to defend the temple. Infiltrating the city through engineering tunnels, Amon discovers that the situation is worse than he thought – the last crystal flickers and fades faster than predicted, water rations are cut in half, and skirmishes for access to fountains are beginning. Nefrit helps organize secret meetings with potential allies among the population, but most still cling to false hope.

## CHAPTER 8: THE DRAMA OF CHOICE

The moderate faction of priests, seeing the evidence, agrees on the need for evacuation. Amon hesitantly shares Idris's vision with Nefrit, who recognizes symbols from ancient forbidden texts describing the primordial home of the gods. High Priest Ptahotep announces a final grand ritual that will supposedly restore the gods' favor. The city splits between fanatics and those willing to leave. Amon realizes he cannot save everyone – only those willing to accept the truth. Against the backdrop of hunger riots and the collapse of the city guard, he organizes a caravan for exodus. The Temple tries to prevent people from leaving, but the remaining members of the engineering guild intervene, providing cover.

## CHAPTER 9: BATTLE FOR THE TEMPLE

Returning to Idris's temple, Amon and the refugees discover that Samira and Zara are holding defense against the "Thirsting Ones" – several hundred desperate people led by Kadir, a former water master from Kusra. Unlike traditional desert dwellers, the "Thirsting Ones" have no experience in careful water management – they use resources until complete depletion and move on, becoming increasingly violent from constant thirst. Amon attempts to negotiate with Kadir, trying to explain the benefits of cooperation and knowledge about the mountains.

## CHAPTER 10: JOURNEY THROUGH THE DESERT

Negotiations with Kadir fail – he and his followers are too desperate to trust anything but immediate access to water. In the midst of the conflict, a powerful sandstorm begins, separating the opposing sides. Using the storm as cover, Amon, Idris, Samira, and the united group of refugees from Netjeru and remaining oasis residents begin a dangerous journey to the mountains. When they seem hopelessly lost in the storm, Idris falls into a trance-like state and begins to lead them with uncanny certainty, following paths revealed in his visions. The storm claims many lives but also erases their tracks from pursuers. On the way, they face unbearable heat, waterless passes, and mountain gorges where each step could cost a life.

## CHAPTER 11: MOUNTAIN TRIALS

Upon arrival in the mountains, the settlers face harsh reality: thin rocky soil that doesn't retain moisture; first rains causing floods due to lack of proper dams; mountain sickness among city dwellers who have never climbed to such heights. When the first buildings collapse and crops fail to take root, many succumb to despair. At this critical moment, Kadir appears with the remains of the "Thirsting Ones" – exhausted by the desert, they offer a truce in exchange for participation in the new settlement. That night, Idris performs a final ritual with the last of his sacred cactus, joined voluntarily by both Amon and Kadir. Their shared vision reveals specific locations in the mountains where water can be found and harvested, binding the former enemies in a common purpose.

## CHAPTER 12: SYNTHESIS OF KNOWLEDGE

Guided by the insights from the vision and practical knowledge from all groups, Amon organizes a "council of wisdom" where each group shares their expertise – city engineers explain hydraulics and dam construction, Rashid's people demonstrate dew collection and drip irrigation methods, former "Thirsting Ones" offer filtration and water purification technologies from their native city, Zara creates hybrid systems combining all approaches. Idris's visionary guidance leads them to discover underground springs exactly where his trances predicted. Conflicts arise, but the common goal of survival forces the parties to find compromises. Massive terracing of slopes begins, creating a system that mirrors patterns Idris saw in his visions but executes them through sound engineering principles.

## CHAPTER 13: SECOND LIFE

After two years of hard work, the new settlement – "Second Life" – begins to show the first signs of sustainability. Terraced slopes retain moisture and soil, a system of dams and reservoirs preserves seasonal rains, dry farms grow drought-resistant crops borrowed from nomads. Kadir, having applied his knowledge to create a multi-level filtration system, becomes a respected member of the community. Samira organizes caravan routes connecting the new settlement with the surrounding world. Idris, no longer needing the sacred cactus, teaches younger members of the community to read the natural signs of water – subtle plant growth, rock formations, wind patterns – knowledge that blends mysticism with practical observation.


# WORLD & GEOGRAPHY

1. **Overall Climate**
    
    - A harsh, desert-like environment reminiscent of a post-golden-age Egypt or Arabia.
        
    - **Scorching days, cold nights**, frequent sandstorms.
        
    - A single, once-mighty **river** bisects the land but has dwindled to a mere trickle in most places.
        
2. **The Great Desert**
    
    - Stretches far beyond the city’s outskirts, dotted with **rare oases**.
        
    - Blistering heat, rolling dunes, and **dangerous wildlife** (jackals, giant lizards, etc.) that have adapted to low water conditions.
        
    - Hidden in the dunes are **ancient ruins**, remnants of old temples once connected to the gods’ domain.
        
3. **Travel & Communication**
    
    - Slow and risky. Caravans traverse well-worn trade paths from oasis to oasis.
        
    - Long journeys require significant water supplies or prior arrangements with local tribes/raiders.

# THE CITY

1. **Location & Layout**
    
    - Built on the **banks of the dwindling river**, historically prospering on trade and fertile farmland.
        
    - The **core** of the city holds temples, the priestly council’s headquarters, and the old water reactor powered by the **main crystal**.
        
    - Outlying districts are in **severe decline**: many abandoned buildings, dusty streets, a near-constant sense of desperation.
        
2. **Population & Daily Life**
    
    - Once a bustling center of commerce, now **fraying at the seams** due to water scarcity.
        
    - People **queue for water rations** daily, often leading to scuffles or riots in the streets.
        
    - Small enclaves of artisans, blacksmiths, and market traders still persist, but many have gone bankrupt or fled.
        
3. **Economy**
    
    - **Water** is the most valuable commodity. Gold and leftover crystal shards also hold value—merchants accept them in exchange for essential supplies.
        
    - Agricultural output is minimal and heavily controlled by those who can afford private wells or small crystal shards.
        
4. **Social Structure**
    
    - **Priesthood**: Officially at the top, but losing legitimacy as the crisis deepens.
        
    - **Noble/Wealthy Families**: Hoard resources behind walled compounds.
        
    - **Common Citizens**: Struggle daily for water and food, stuck between faith, resentment, and hopelessness.
        
    - **Laborers/Engineers**: Skilled workers like Amon are vital to maintaining any infrastructure, though often undervalued by the priesthood.

# THE PRIESTHOOD

1. **Historical Role**
    
    - Acted as **direct conduits** for the gods, advising on architecture, moral codes, mechanical wonders.
        
    - When the gods fell silent, **priests lost their direct link**, but clung to power through tradition and dogma.
        
2. **Current Factions**
    
    - **Hardliners**: Insist that absolute faith will restore divine favor. Oppose mortal attempts at solutions.
        
    - **Moderates**: Quietly seek practical ways to save the city, uneasy about discarding faith but willing to accept rational methods.
        
3. **Authority & Public Perception**
    
    - Still hold **formal control** over the city’s governance and resource distribution.
        
    - Public trust erodes as water shortages worsen—riots often target priests or temple warehouses.
        
    - They have armed enforcers (temple guards, small militias) to maintain order but are spread thin.

# CRYSTALS & MECHANICAL TECH

1. **Origins**
    
    - Created or bestowed by the **two god-brothers** in a past golden era. Formerly capable of **generating water**, sustaining farmland, powering advanced mechanisms.
        
    - Since the gods’ departure, the crystals are **depleting** and cannot be renewed. No one can recreate that original “divine spark.”
        
2. **Modern Properties**
    
        
    - **Instability**: When tampered with incorrectly (e.g., recharging attempts), they can **explode** or shatter.
        
    - **Finite**: Each crystal has diminishing reserves. Shards may still be useful for sensors or mechanical feedback.
        
3. **Water Reactor**
    
    - A central **device** in the city that used to harness a main crystal to produce/clean water on a larger scale.
        
    - Now nearly nonfunctional, as the crystal within is almost depleted.
        
    - **Security** is lax due to resource shortages and overconfidence in priestly dogma.
        
4. **Ancient Aqueducts**
    
    - Hidden tunnels and systems constructed under divine guidance. These used crystals for **automated flow control**.
        
    - With divine oversight gone, many are defunct or in disrepair, but can be partially **reactivated** with mechanical fixes and leftover shards.

# DESERT TRIBES & NOMADS

1. **Rashid ibn Qadi’s Tribe**
    
    - Live near a **natural oasis** fed by an underground cistern. Fiercely protective of their water source.
        
    - Rely on **low-tech methods**: dew-collecting nets, strict rationing, communal water governance.
        
    - Historically spurned by city-dwellers as “barbarians,” they harbor distrust for big urban centers.
        
2. **Cultural Traits**
    
    - Oral tradition with strong moral codes. Oases are considered **sacred** to them.
        
    - Extended families or clans share resources and function cooperatively to survive.
        
    - Some, like **Zara** the tinkerer, experiment with mechanical devices or crystal shards found in old ruins.
        
3. **Relations with the City**
    
    - Mostly avoid direct contact, trading occasionally at inflated rates.
        
    - They resent the city for once mocking their “primitive” ways—now the city crumbles while the tribe endures.

# RAIDERS & OUTLAWS

1. **Samira al-Khuri’s Band**
    
    - Operate in the deep desert, striking caravans that exploit high water prices or hoard crystals.
        
    - They see themselves as **robin-hood–style** vigilantes, redistributing stolen water or goods to desperate desert settlements.
        
    - Samira tolerates no betrayal; her group is fiercely loyal but pragmatic. They may align with Amon if it promises mutual benefit.
        
2. **Other Raider Factions**
    
    - Some are plain marauders, driven by greed or desperation. They do not hesitate to kill.
        
    - Their existence underscores how **dangerous** and **lawless** the desert has become without the gods’ stabilizing influence.
        

---

# TEMPLE RUINS & THE MAD SCRIBE

1. **Idris the Exiled Scholar-Priest**
    
    - Lives in a **half-buried temple** or ancient library, filled with scrolls and half-broken devices.
        
    - Saw early on that the gods were gone for good, driving him to obsessive research on crystals’ true nature.
        
    - Half-crazed by isolation, but still a **vital link** to historical knowledge.
        
2. **Ruin Layout**
    
    - Crumbling corridors, some **dangerous traps** or collapsed sections.
        
    - Possibly small contraptions or golems that half-function on leftover crystal energy.
        
    - Contains old references to **aqueduct systems** and mechanical “divine instructions” once used to maintain them.
        

---

# ECONOMIC & SOCIAL DYNAMICS

1. **Trade**
    
    - Long-distance trade is **risky**, reliant on caravans crossing the desert.
        
    - Common goods: dried foods, salt, leftover crystal shards, metals.
        
    - **Water** or water-related technology fetches the highest price, overshadowing gold in daily life.
        
2. **City Divisions**
    
    - Wealthy estates hoard resources.
        
    - Priests control official water distribution but are losing control as the main reactor fails.
        
    - **Black Market** or underground trading, often run by unscrupulous merchants like Nazim, thrives in the chaos.
        
3. **Social Attitudes**
    
    - **Faithful**: Some remain devout, hoping the gods will return if they prove worthy.
        
    - **Skeptics**: Growing number believe the gods are gone forever, turning to practical solutions (or criminality).
        
    - **Desperate**: Majority who don’t care about dogma or science—just survival.

# TECH & ENGINEERING

1. **General Level**
    
    - Comparable to a mixture of **late medieval** or **early mechanical** era, with remnants of higher technology from the gods’ instructions.
        
    - Simple gears, pulleys, water wheels are common, but large-scale machines are rare and usually reliant on crystal-based designs.
        
2. **Amon’s Expertise**
    
    - Specializes in **water management** systems, like pumps, valves, pressure regulators.
        
    - He recognizes mechanical solutions can supplant failing crystals to some extent, but lacks the divine spark needed for miraculous water creation.
        
3. **Potential Innovations**
    
    - Hybrid solutions combining leftover crystal shards as **“sensors”** or **“flow stabilizers”** with **wind or pedal-powered pumps**.
        
    - Reclaiming ancient aqueducts is viable if one can bypass or replace the divine components with mechanical contraptions.

## ⚙️ Engineering Rules of the Setting

To ensure consistency as you write, here are principles you can follow:

|Topic|Realistic World Rule|
|---|---|
|**Crystals**|Act as **passive regulators**: humidity sensors, thermal triggers, mild amplifiers. Never energy sources.|
|**Water systems**|All pumps, aqueducts, and valves are **mechanical** and require manpower or natural gravity.|
|**Desert survival tech**|Uses real-world methods: **dew nets**, **cisterns**, **buried ceramic pots** to reduce evaporation.|
|**Repair skills**|Focus on **materials science** (wood, rope, metal wear), **leverage**, **fluid dynamics**, and **manual machining** with limited tools.|
|**Transport & Energy**|No combustion engines. Only muscle, wind, gravity, or very crude pressure systems (e.g., heat expansion).|

# LAW & ORDER (OR LACK THEREOF)

1. **Temple Guards**
    
    - Supposed to maintain peace in the city, but underpaid and demoralized.
        
    - Some are loyal to Hardliners, others just want stable employment.
        
2. **Desert Law**
    
    - Outside city walls, law is basically the **strongest rule** or local tribal codes.
        
    - Raiders do as they please unless confronted by well-armed caravans or tribe defenders.
        
3. **Conflict Drivers**
    
    - The city’s meltdown spurs **internal strife** (riots, sabotage) and **external raids**.
        
    - Water scarcity intensifies **violence**, making alliances (like Samira’s or with tribes) either crucial or dangerous.
        

---

# ATMOSPHERE & TONE

1. **Harsh, Unforgiving**
    
    - The environment is as much an antagonist as any raider or priest. Sun, sand, thirst—always pressing.
        
2. **Decay & Desperation**
    
    - Crumbling grandeur of a once-thriving civilization.
        
    - Hope is slim but present in pockets of innovation and cooperation.
        
3. **Subtle Wonder**
    
    - The lingering presence of lost gods, half-functional relics, and the faint glow of crystals add a **mystical** flavor without overshadowing the **real** struggle of survival.

## HOW TO USE THIS SETTING REFERENCE

- **Check consistency** whenever you write scenes involving desert travel, city politics, or crystal-powered mechanisms.
    
- **Keep water scarcity** front and center: it’s the driving force behind social tensions, economics, and moral decisions.
    
- **Highlight factional nuances** in the priesthood, city guard, and desert tribes. No group is monolithic; internal disagreements can shape the plot.
    
- **Leave the gods’ departure** an open question—maybe add rumors, legends, or partial truths, but let the mystery linger.
    

With these guidelines, you have a **comprehensive yet flexible** foundation to craft scenes, develop subplots, and maintain a believable world. Feel free to expand or refine details as new story twists arise, but this reference ensures the core elements stay cohesive and compelling.
