## CHAPTER 1: THE DYING CITY

1. **Opening Scene**
    
    - The sun beats down on the riverside mining town. The once-mighty river has shrunk to a muddy trickle.
        
    - We see crowds lined up at water-ration stations, their hope and patience wearing thin.
        
2. **Amon’s Concern**
    
    - **Amon**, the city’s water engineer, inspects the main crystal in the water reactor—it’s nearly depleted.
        
    - He tries explaining to a minor priest that action must be taken now, but the priest just repeats the council’s mantra: “Pray harder; the gods will bless us again.”
        
3. **Societal Decay**
    
    - The market is almost empty; everything costs exorbitant prices. Fights break out over basic necessities.
        
    - Amon overhears rumors that caravans demand gold or leftover crystal shards in exchange for even a single barrel of water.
        
4. **Priestly Power Struggle (Foreshadowing)**
    
    - We glimpse **two priestly factions**:
        
        - **Hardliners**: Denounce any mortal solutions as heresy.
            
        - **Moderates**: Quietly worried and willing to consider alternative ideas.
            

---

## CHAPTER 2: THE HERETICAL EXPERIMENT

1. **Amon’s Experiment**
    
    - Desperate, Amon sneaks into the reactor’s chamber and uses a chisel to break off a **small shard** of the main crystal.
        
    - Using an old mechanical apparatus, plus moonlight and some half-remembered chants, he attempts to “recharge” the shard.
        
2. **Explosion & Fallout**
    
    - The shard **explodes** in a burst of unstable energy—startling night-watch guards and attracting the priests’ attention.
        
    - Fires break out; a few people are injured. Amon barely escapes with minor burns.
        
3. **Trial & Banishment**
    
    - The Hardliner Priests, outraged, declare Amon’s act “proof of mortal hubris.” They hold a brief public hearing in the temple courtyard.
        
    - Amon is **banished** to the desert under threat of death if he returns empty-handed. The crowd is either horrified or strangely relieved to see him go.
        
4. **Seeds of Support**
    
    - **Sadaet**, a moderate priestess, secretly tells Amon she believes he was only trying to help. She gives him a small bag of supplies and whispers, “Return if you must, but be prepared to face more than you imagine.”
        

---

## CHAPTER 3: INTO THE SANDS

1. **The Desert’s Wrath**
    
    - Amon trudges through endless dunes. Days of brutal heat, nights of icy wind. He’s overwhelmed, physically and mentally.
        
    - Scarce water means he’s rationing every drop; we see him fighting off hallucinations and borderline heatstroke.
        
2. **Desperate Encounter**
    
    - A lone desert predator (a mutated jackal or lizard) attacks him at night. Amon injures it with a makeshift spear, barely surviving.
        
    - The brutality of the wilderness sets in: no city walls, no help—only his wits and will.
        
3. **Appearance of Samira’s Riders**
    
    - **Samira al-Khuri** and her small band of raiders spot Amon. Initially, they suspect he’s a spy or a stranded caravaneer.
        
    - After questioning him, Samira recognizes Amon as “the fool engineer” who was cast out. She decides to spare him, intrigued by his knowledge of crystals and city infrastructure.
        
4. **Truce Over the Campfire**
    
    - Samira shares a little water, but demands Amon fix a half-functional device her crew uses to locate hidden wells.
        
    - Amon adjusts a broken dial or gear, showing his engineering skill. In exchange, he learns that Samira often targets priestly caravans believed to hoard or smuggle crystals.
        

---

## CHAPTER 4: A MEETING WITH NAZIM

1. **Hidden Desert Trading Post**
    
    - Samira brings Amon to a makeshift camp in a rocky canyon, where **Nazim al-Hadid**, a traveling merchant, has pitched his tent.
        
    - Nazim greets them flamboyantly, offering an array of goods—**crystal shards, mechanical salvage, desert herbs**—all at steep prices.
        
2. **Information Exchange**
    
    - Over tea (steeped in minimal water), Nazim shares news: the city’s water shortage has reached crisis levels; riots are rumored daily.
        
    - He also mentions that deep in the desert lies **Rashid ibn Qadi’s** oasis tribe—master survivors who rely minimally on crystal power.
        
    - This conversation stokes Amon’s hope: perhaps these tribes have solutions the city can replicate.
        
3. **Amon’s Decision**
    
    - Realizing he needs more practical water-management knowledge, Amon resolves to find Rashid’s tribe.
        
    - Samira, curious about forging alliances that might pay off, agrees to escort him partway—though she has her own reasons (maybe the tribe deals with caravans she wants to intercept).
        

---

## CHAPTER 5: RASHID’S OASIS

1. **Treacherous Journey**
    
    - After days navigating sandstorms and scorching sun, they arrive at a surprising patch of green: **Rashid’s oasis**.
        
    - They see **palm trees**, a small pond fed by an **underground cistern**, and carefully placed dew-collecting nets.
        
2. **Tribal Customs**
    
    - Amon and Samira’s band are greeted warily by the tribe’s guards. Rashid, the proud chieftain, demands to know why city people have come.
        
    - Tension rises. Rashid harbors resentment: city-dwellers and priests once looked down on “barbaric desert folk.”
        
3. **Mutual Benefit**
    
    - Amon demonstrates a fix for one of the tribe’s rope pulleys, which helps draw water more efficiently from their cistern.
        
    - Moved by this gesture, Rashid agrees to share knowledge of **low-tech water preservation**. He shows Amon that it’s possible to survive with almost no crystal reliance—if you ration strictly and harness natural resources (like dew-collectors).
        
4. **Zara, the Tinkerer**
    
    - **Zara**, a young inventor in the tribe, displays small mechanical devices that sense moisture using leftover crystal shards. She’s partially reverse-engineered them from ancient relics.
        
    - Amon realizes these shards can still channel and stabilize **small** energy flows. The divine spark might be gone, but there’s still a measurable effect that, on a larger scale, could help his city.
        

---

## CHAPTER 6: IDRIS’S RUINED TEMPLE

1. **Exiled Scholar-Priest**
    
    - At Rashid’s suggestion, Amon travels a day’s ride to a **half-buried temple** where **Idris**, a “mad scribe,” is rumored to reside.
        
    - Samira departs to pursue her next caravan raid, but leaves Amon a token for future contact.
        
    - Zara decides to accompany Amon, excited about potential discoveries.
        
2. **Inside the Crumbling Halls**
    
    - They find Idris, disheveled and rambling, surrounded by faded scrolls and bizarre mechanical parts.
        
    - Initially suspicious, he challenges their motives, ranting about the gods’ silence.
        
3. **Crucial Revelations**
    
    - After earning Idris’s trust (maybe by showing him Zara’s devices), they learn that **ancient aqueducts** lie beneath the city, originally maintained by crystals that regulated water flow and pressure.
        
    - Idris warns: without the gods to “command” them, these systems are defunct. But with mechanical modifications and the crystals’ leftover resonance, it might be possible to reactivate them—**partially**.
        
4. **Dark Omens**
    
    - Idris also reveals how dangerous it is to tamper with depleted crystals. They can explode if improperly used (explaining Amon’s earlier lab failure).
        
    - Still, he encourages Amon: “Better you try something than let the city rot.” He hands them old schematics and urges them to hurry.
        

---

## CHAPTER 7: RETURN TO CHAOS

1. **Long Trek Home**
    
    - Amon and Zara journey back, enduring more desert hardships. Perhaps they’re caught in a severe sandstorm, bonding through shared survival.
        
    - She’s awed by how the city might look, having never seen it up close.
        
2. **City on the Brink**
    
    - They arrive to find the streets half-deserted. The main crystal flickers weakly, barely sustaining any water flow.
        
    - Lines for water rations have turned violent. People fight in the dusty public squares, some bodies lying motionless from dehydration.
        
3. **Priestly Infighting**
    
    - Sadaet arranges a secret meeting with Amon at a disused chapel. She explains how the Hardliner faction has cracked down on dissent, punishing anyone who questions the gods’ “imminent return.”
        
    - The populace is **split**: some cling to faith, others are so desperate they might try anything Amon suggests.
        
4. **A Sliver of Hope**
    
    - Amon, with Zara’s help, reveals Idris’s schematics and the plan to **repair underground aqueducts**. They’ll need laborers, scrap metal, and a few leftover shards to serve as pressure regulators.
        

---

## CHAPTER 8: UNDERGROUND LABORS

1. **Excavating the Old Tunnels**
    
    - Over **several weeks**, a small team of loyal workers (some city folk, maybe a few desert dwellers who accompanied Amon, plus Sadaet’s hidden support) cleans debris from the ancient channels.
        
    - The air is stale and thick with dust. Collapsed sections must be cleared or reinforced with scavenged beams.
        
2. **Mechanical Ingenuity**
    
    - Amon and Zara repurpose old city gates and broken carts for metal. They build rudimentary pumps to draw water from deeper underground pockets.
        
    - They carefully place **crystal shards** in specialized mounts to stabilize pressure flow, mindful of the explosion risk.
        
3. **Mounting Tension**
    
    - Hardliner priests spread rumors that Amon’s “contraption” will anger the gods. Some laborers quit, fearing divine wrath.
        
    - Sadaet discreetly recruits more help from among the city’s moderate faithful, explaining that the gods wouldn’t want total annihilation.
        
4. **Setbacks**
    
    - Part of the tunnel collapses during a minor earthquake or cave-in. Workers are hurt; morale dips.
        
    - Amon nearly loses hope, but Zara’s optimism keeps him moving forward.
        

---

## CHAPTER 9: SABOTAGE & ULTIMATUM

1. **Hardliner Coup Attempt**
    
    - On the eve of testing the new water-pump system, Hardliner priests incite a mob to storm the underground site. They claim this is the final test from the gods, and meddling with the city’s “sacred underbelly” is blasphemy.
        
    - Tools and components are smashed; fights break out among workers.
        
2. **Allies to the Rescue**
    
    - **Samira** and her raiders, who have been watching the city from afar, unexpectedly intervene. She sees an opportunity for stable alliances and possibly a share of water.
        
    - They help drive off or disarm the mob. The city guard, led by a conflicted **Captain Daru Khan** (if you choose to include him), stands down rather than escalate the violence further.
        
3. **Standoff with the Priests**
    
    - In a tense confrontation, Amon confronts the High Priest of the Hardliners. Sadaet publicly sides with Amon, urging the people to see reason: “Better to act than die waiting for a silent heaven.”
        
    - The Hardliner Priest threatens “eternal damnation,” but many in the crowd see that the old ways have led them to the brink. Support swings toward Amon’s plan.
        
4. **A Narrow Window**
    
    - With the confrontation momentarily defused, Amon and Zara scramble to salvage the damaged machinery. They must get the system running **now**—the city’s water supplies are nearly gone.
        

---

## CHAPTER 10: WATER FLOWS

1. **Activating the Pumps**
    
    - In a dramatic nighttime sequence, torches flicker in the tunnels. Workers finalize repairs.
        
    - Amon carefully seats the final crystal shards into their regulators, triple-checking connections. Zara mans a hand-crank to prime the pump.
        
2. **Success**
    
    - With a groan of ancient pipes, water surges up from deep underground. At first, it’s muddy and sluggish, but quickly clears.
        
    - The crowd gathered above ground gasps as water spills into a newly patched canal.
        
3. **Hardliner Priests Unmasked**
    
    - Some Hardliners try one last sabotage. They’re stopped by Samira’s group or the city guard. Realizing they’ve lost public favor, they flee or are arrested.
        
4. **Triumph & Restraint**
    
    - The water is **limited**—enough to sustain the population with strict rationing. The crisis is not entirely over, but the city can breathe again.
        
    - Cheers erupt in the streets. Some kneel in silent wonder. Sadaet prays privately, perhaps bridging faith and reason.
        

---

## CHAPTER 11: NEW ORDER

1. **Reallocation of Power**
    
    - Sadaet and the moderate priests gain credibility. They issue a reformed policy, mixing measured faith with acceptance that mortal solutions are necessary.
        
    - Samira’s band is offered amnesty; in return, they agree to patrol trade routes and keep peace from external raiders—profitable for them, beneficial for the city.
        
2. **Rashid’s Tribe Acknowledged**
    
    - The city negotiates a trade deal with Rashid: knowledge sharing (like dew-collection methods) for refined goods or partial water from the new system. Mutual respect forms.
        
3. **Amon’s Choice**
    
    - Amon, battered and changed by his ordeals, is hailed as a hero. Yet some still see him as a heretic.
        
    - He might **stay** to perfect the system, ensuring it’s sustainable, or choose to wander further, searching for more lost technologies.
        
    - Zara contemplates traveling with him or continuing her research in the city’s new workshops.
        
4. **Lingering Mysteries**
    
    - Idris remains in his temple, possibly visited occasionally for counsel.
        
    - The deeper reasons behind the gods’ departure remain unanswered—whispers persist that they watch from afar or abandoned mortals entirely.
        

---

## CHAPTER 12 (EPILOGUE): THE FIRST HARVEST

1. **A Glimpse of the Future**
    
    - Several weeks or months later, we see **modest** greenery returning to patches of farmland around the city’s canals.
        
    - People still queue for water rations, but the lines are orderly and hopeful. Children splash in a small public fountain for the first time in years.
        
2. **Uncertain Yet Hopeful**
    
    - Rumors spread of other cities in the same predicament—some might request help or fear the city’s new rise in power.
        
    - A final scene shows Amon (or whomever you choose) reflecting on the cost of survival and the work still needed. But for now, there’s **water**, and with it, a fragile new life.
        
3. **Open-Ended Possibility**
    
    - Whether the gods ever return, or if humanity is truly alone, remains the mystery that colors every sunset over the desert.
        
    - The city, transformed by mortal sweat and ingenuity, stands as a testament: **even in a godless age, hope and life can still bloom**.


# WORLD & GEOGRAPHY

1. **Overall Climate**
    
    - A harsh, desert-like environment reminiscent of a post-golden-age Egypt or Arabia.
        
    - **Scorching days, cold nights**, frequent sandstorms.
        
    - A single, once-mighty **river** bisects the land but has dwindled to a mere trickle in most places.
        
2. **The Great Desert**
    
    - Stretches far beyond the city’s outskirts, dotted with **rare oases**.
        
    - Blistering heat, rolling dunes, and **dangerous wildlife** (jackals, giant lizards, etc.) that have adapted to low water conditions.
        
    - Hidden in the dunes are **ancient ruins**, remnants of old temples once connected to the gods’ domain.
        
3. **Travel & Communication**
    
    - Slow and risky. Caravans traverse well-worn trade paths from oasis to oasis.
        
    - Long journeys require significant water supplies or prior arrangements with local tribes/raiders.
        

---

# THE CITY

1. **Location & Layout**
    
    - Built on the **banks of the dwindling river**, historically prospering on trade and fertile farmland.
        
    - The **core** of the city holds temples, the priestly council’s headquarters, and the old water reactor powered by the **main crystal**.
        
    - Outlying districts are in **severe decline**: many abandoned buildings, dusty streets, a near-constant sense of desperation.
        
2. **Population & Daily Life**
    
    - Once a bustling center of commerce, now **fraying at the seams** due to water scarcity.
        
    - People **queue for water rations** daily, often leading to scuffles or riots in the streets.
        
    - Small enclaves of artisans, blacksmiths, and market traders still persist, but many have gone bankrupt or fled.
        
3. **Economy**
    
    - **Water** is the most valuable commodity. Gold and leftover crystal shards also hold value—merchants accept them in exchange for essential supplies.
        
    - Agricultural output is minimal and heavily controlled by those who can afford private wells or small crystal shards.
        
4. **Social Structure**
    
    - **Priesthood**: Officially at the top, but losing legitimacy as the crisis deepens.
        
    - **Noble/Wealthy Families**: Hoard resources behind walled compounds.
        
    - **Common Citizens**: Struggle daily for water and food, stuck between faith, resentment, and hopelessness.
        
    - **Laborers/Engineers**: Skilled workers like Amon are vital to maintaining any infrastructure, though often undervalued by the priesthood.
        

---

# THE PRIESTHOOD

1. **Historical Role**
    
    - Acted as **direct conduits** for the gods, advising on architecture, moral codes, mechanical wonders.
        
    - When the gods fell silent, **priests lost their direct link**, but clung to power through tradition and dogma.
        
2. **Current Factions**
    
    - **Hardliners**: Insist that absolute faith will restore divine favor. Oppose mortal attempts at solutions.
        
    - **Moderates**: Quietly seek practical ways to save the city, uneasy about discarding faith but willing to accept rational methods.
        
3. **Authority & Public Perception**
    
    - Still hold **formal control** over the city’s governance and resource distribution.
        
    - Public trust erodes as water shortages worsen—riots often target priests or temple warehouses.
        
    - They have armed enforcers (temple guards, small militias) to maintain order but are spread thin.
        

---

# CRYSTALS & MECHANICAL TECH

1. **Origins**
    
    - Created or bestowed by the **two god-brothers** in a past golden era. Formerly capable of **generating water**, sustaining farmland, powering advanced mechanisms.
        
    - Since the gods’ departure, the crystals are **depleting** and cannot be renewed. No one can recreate that original “divine spark.”
        
2. **Modern Properties**
    
    - **Catalysts/Regulators**: They amplify or stabilize existing flows (of water, temperature, or minor energies).
        
    - **Instability**: When tampered with incorrectly (e.g., recharging attempts), they can **explode** or shatter.
        
    - **Finite**: Each crystal has diminishing reserves. Shards may still be useful for sensors or mechanical feedback.
        
3. **Water Reactor**
    
    - A central **device** in the city that used to harness a main crystal to produce/clean water on a larger scale.
        
    - Now nearly nonfunctional, as the crystal within is almost depleted.
        
    - **Security** is lax due to resource shortages and overconfidence in priestly dogma.
        
4. **Ancient Aqueducts**
    
    - Hidden tunnels and systems constructed under divine guidance. These used crystals for **automated flow control**.
        
    - With divine oversight gone, many are defunct or in disrepair, but can be partially **reactivated** with mechanical fixes and leftover shards.
        

---

# DESERT TRIBES & NOMADS

1. **Rashid ibn Qadi’s Tribe**
    
    - Live near a **natural oasis** fed by an underground cistern. Fiercely protective of their water source.
        
    - Rely on **low-tech methods**: dew-collecting nets, strict rationing, communal water governance.
        
    - Historically spurned by city-dwellers as “barbarians,” they harbor distrust for big urban centers.
        
2. **Cultural Traits**
    
    - Oral tradition with strong moral codes. Oases are considered **sacred** to them.
        
    - Extended families or clans share resources and function cooperatively to survive.
        
    - Some, like **Zara** the tinkerer, experiment with mechanical devices or crystal shards found in old ruins.
        
3. **Relations with the City**
    
    - Mostly avoid direct contact, trading occasionally at inflated rates.
        
    - They resent the city for once mocking their “primitive” ways—now the city crumbles while the tribe endures.
        

---

# RAIDERS & OUTLAWS

1. **Samira al-Khuri’s Band**
    
    - Operate in the deep desert, striking caravans that exploit high water prices or hoard crystals.
        
    - They see themselves as **robin-hood–style** vigilantes, redistributing stolen water or goods to desperate desert settlements.
        
    - Samira tolerates no betrayal; her group is fiercely loyal but pragmatic. They may align with Amon if it promises mutual benefit.
        
2. **Other Raider Factions**
    
    - Some are plain marauders, driven by greed or desperation. They do not hesitate to kill.
        
    - Their existence underscores how **dangerous** and **lawless** the desert has become without the gods’ stabilizing influence.
        

---

# TEMPLE RUINS & THE MAD SCRIBE

1. **Idris the Exiled Scholar-Priest**
    
    - Lives in a **half-buried temple** or ancient library, filled with scrolls and half-broken devices.
        
    - Saw early on that the gods were gone for good, driving him to obsessive research on crystals’ true nature.
        
    - Half-crazed by isolation, but still a **vital link** to historical knowledge.
        
2. **Ruin Layout**
    
    - Crumbling corridors, some **dangerous traps** or collapsed sections.
        
    - Possibly small contraptions or golems that half-function on leftover crystal energy.
        
    - Contains old references to **aqueduct systems** and mechanical “divine instructions” once used to maintain them.
        

---

# ECONOMIC & SOCIAL DYNAMICS

1. **Trade**
    
    - Long-distance trade is **risky**, reliant on caravans crossing the desert.
        
    - Common goods: dried foods, salt, leftover crystal shards, metals.
        
    - **Water** or water-related technology fetches the highest price, overshadowing gold in daily life.
        
2. **City Divisions**
    
    - Wealthy estates hoard resources.
        
    - Priests control official water distribution but are losing control as the main reactor fails.
        
    - **Black Market** or underground trading, often run by unscrupulous merchants like Nazim, thrives in the chaos.
        
3. **Social Attitudes**
    
    - **Faithful**: Some remain devout, hoping the gods will return if they prove worthy.
        
    - **Skeptics**: Growing number believe the gods are gone forever, turning to practical solutions (or criminality).
        
    - **Desperate**: Majority who don’t care about dogma or science—just survival.
        

---

# TECH & ENGINEERING

1. **General Level**
    
    - Comparable to a mixture of **late medieval** or **early mechanical** era, with remnants of higher technology from the gods’ instructions.
        
    - Simple gears, pulleys, water wheels are common, but large-scale machines are rare and usually reliant on crystal-based designs.
        
2. **Amon’s Expertise**
    
    - Specializes in **water management** systems, like pumps, valves, pressure regulators.
        
    - He recognizes mechanical solutions can supplant failing crystals to some extent, but lacks the divine spark needed for miraculous water creation.
        
3. **Potential Innovations**
    
    - Hybrid solutions combining leftover crystal shards as **“sensors”** or **“flow stabilizers”** with **wind or pedal-powered pumps**.
        
    - Reclaiming ancient aqueducts is viable if one can bypass or replace the divine components with mechanical contraptions.
        

---

# LAW & ORDER (OR LACK THEREOF)

1. **Temple Guards**
    
    - Supposed to maintain peace in the city, but underpaid and demoralized.
        
    - Some are loyal to Hardliners, others just want stable employment.
        
2. **Desert Law**
    
    - Outside city walls, law is basically the **strongest rule** or local tribal codes.
        
    - Raiders do as they please unless confronted by well-armed caravans or tribe defenders.
        
3. **Conflict Drivers**
    
    - The city’s meltdown spurs **internal strife** (riots, sabotage) and **external raids**.
        
    - Water scarcity intensifies **violence**, making alliances (like Samira’s or with tribes) either crucial or dangerous.
        

---

# ATMOSPHERE & TONE

1. **Harsh, Unforgiving**
    
    - The environment is as much an antagonist as any raider or priest. Sun, sand, thirst—always pressing.
        
2. **Decay & Desperation**
    
    - Crumbling grandeur of a once-thriving civilization.
        
    - Hope is slim but present in pockets of innovation and cooperation.
        
3. **Subtle Wonder**
    
    - The lingering presence of lost gods, half-functional relics, and the faint glow of crystals add a **mystical** flavor without overshadowing the **real** struggle of survival.

## HOW TO USE THIS SETTING REFERENCE

- **Check consistency** whenever you write scenes involving desert travel, city politics, or crystal-powered mechanisms.
    
- **Keep water scarcity** front and center: it’s the driving force behind social tensions, economics, and moral decisions.
    
- **Highlight factional nuances** in the priesthood, city guard, and desert tribes. No group is monolithic; internal disagreements can shape the plot.
    
- **Leave the gods’ departure** an open question—maybe add rumors, legends, or partial truths, but let the mystery linger.
    

With these guidelines, you have a **comprehensive yet flexible** foundation to craft scenes, develop subplots, and maintain a believable world. Feel free to expand or refine details as new story twists arise, but this reference ensures the core elements stay cohesive and compelling.
